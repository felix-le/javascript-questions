felix-le: what is HTML elements

GitHub Copilot: HTML (HyperText Markup Language) elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. They are represented by tags. An HTML element consists of a start tag, some content, and an end tag.

For example, the `<p>` tag represents a paragraph element in HTML:

```html
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
```

In this example, `<p>` is the start tag, `This is a paragraph.` is the content, and `</p>` is the end tag. The whole line is considered an HTML element.

Some HTML elements are empty and don't have a closing tag, like the `<img>` tag for images or the `<br>` tag for line breaks.

felix-le: What are some commonly used HTML elements for structuring web pages?

GitHub Copilot: Here are some commonly used HTML elements for structuring web pages:

- `<html>`: This is the root element of an HTML page.

- `<head>`: This contains meta-information about the HTML document, including `<title>`, which defines the title of the document, and `<link>`, which is used to link to external stylesheets.

- `<body>`: This contains the content of the HTML document, such as text, images, and so on.

- `<header>`: This is used to contain introductory content or a set of navigational links.

- `<nav>`: This is used to define a set of navigation links.

- `<main>`: This is used to specify the main content of a document.

- `<article>`: This represents an independent piece of content of a document, such as a blog entry or newspaper article.

- `<section>`: This represents a standalone section of a document, which should ideally have a heading.

- `<aside>`: This is used for content that is tangentially related to the content around it, and which could be considered separate from that content.

- `<footer>`: This is used to contain information about the author, copyright information, and so on.

- `<div>`: This is a generic container for flow content, which does not inherently represent anything. It can be used to group elements for styling purposes.

- `<span>`: This is a generic inline container for phrasing content, which does not inherently represent anything. It can be used to group elements for styling purposes.

Here's an example of how these elements might be used in a basic HTML document:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Page Title</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <header>
      <h1>This is a Heading</h1>
      <nav>
        <a href="#">Link</a> | <a href="#">Link</a> |
        <a href="#">Link</a>
      </nav>
    </header>
    <main>
      <article>
        <h2>This is a Subheading</h2>
        <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
        <section>
          <h3>This is a Sub-subheading</h3>
          <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
        </section>
      </article>
    </main>
    <footer>
      <p>Footer information goes here</p>
    </footer>
  </body>
</html>
```

felix-le: what is difference between block and inline block css

GitHub Copilot: In CSS, `block` and `inline-block` are values for the `display` property that determine how an element is displayed in the document flow.

- `block`: Elements with `display: block` create a block-level box. Block-level elements start on a new line and stretch out to the left and right as far as they can. Examples of block-level elements include `<div>`, `<p>`, and `<h1>` to `<h6>`.

- `inline-block`: Elements with `display: inline-block` are like `inline` elements but they can have a width and height. That means you can allow them to freely flow with text (like `inline` elements) but still control their box-model properties like `width`, `height`, `padding`, `margin`, and `border` (like `block` elements). An example of an inline-block element is `<img>`.

Here's a simple comparison:

```css
.block {
  display: block;
  width: 50%;
  height: 100px;
  background-color: blue;
}

.inline-block {
  display: inline-block;
  width: 50%;
  height: 100px;
  background-color: red;
}
```

In this example, elements with the `block` class will take up the full width available, and subsequent elements will start on a new line. Elements with the `inline-block` class will take up only as much width as necessary, and subsequent elements can appear on the same line.

felix-le: explain px,rem em in css (and other if has)

GitHub Copilot: Sure, here are explanations for `px`, `em`, `rem`, and a few other units in CSS:

1. **px (pixels):** This is a unit of length in CSS. One pixel represents a dot on the computer screen, the smallest unit of measure. It's an absolute unit, meaning it represents the same size regardless of any parent font size settings.

2. **em:** This is a relative unit of length. It's relative to the font-size of the parent element. For example, if the parent element has a font-size of 20px, then "1em" would be equal to 20px for that element. If the parent has no set font-size, the default is usually 16px, so "1em" would be 16px.

3. **rem (root em):** This is also a relative unit of length, but it's relative to the root element (usually `<html>`). This means that "1rem" equals the font size of the root element. If the root element has no set font-size, the default is usually 16px, so "1rem" would be 16px.

4. **% (percent):** This is a relative unit that's a percentage of the parent element. For example, if you set the width of an element to 50%, it will take up half of the width of its parent element.

5. **vh (viewport height):** This is a relative unit that's based on the height of the viewport (the visible area of the webpage). "1vh" is equal to 1% of the viewport's height.

6. **vw (viewport width):** This is a relative unit that's based on the width of the viewport. "1vw" is equal to 1% of the viewport's width.

7. **pt (points):** This is an absolute unit commonly used for print media (1pt = 1/72 of an inch). It's not recommended for screen display, as the actual size can vary depending on the screen resolution.

8. **cm, mm, in (centimeters, millimeters, inches):** These are absolute units and not recommended for screen display because screen sizes vary, but they can be useful for print stylesheets.

Remember, when using relative units like `em`, `rem`, `%`, `vh`, and `vw`, the size is relative to another value, so it can change depending on the context. This can make your design more responsive and flexible.

felix-le: 20 questions and answers of CSS for front end developer

GitHub Copilot: Sure, here are 20 questions and answers related to CSS for a front-end developer:

1. **Question:** What is CSS?
   **Answer:** CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is a style sheet language used for describing the look and formatting of a document written in HTML or XML. It provides the visual aspects of web pages.

2. **Question:** What are the different ways to insert CSS styles into a webpage?
   **Answer:** There are three ways: Inline CSS (by using the `style` attribute in HTML elements), Internal CSS (by using a `<style>` block in the `<head>` section), and External CSS (by linking to an external CSS file).

3. **Question:** What is a CSS selector?
   **Answer:** A CSS selector is the part of a CSS rule set that actually selects the content you want to style. Selectors can select HTML elements based on their id, class, type, attribute etc.

4. **Question:** What is the difference between "id" and "class" in CSS?
   **Answer:** An "id" is a unique identifier for an element, while a "class" can be applied to multiple elements. An "id" has a higher specificity than a "class".

5. **Question:** What is the box model in CSS?
   **Answer:** The box model in CSS describes the boxes which are being generated for HTML elements. The box model consists of: margins, borders, padding, and the actual content.

6. **Question:** What is the difference between "block" and "inline" display in CSS?
   **Answer:** "block" elements take up the full width available, with a new line before and after (e.g., `<h1>`, `<p>`, and `<div>`), while "inline" elements only take up as much width as necessary and do not force new lines (e.g., `<span>`, `<a>`, and `<img>`).

7. **Question:** What is a pseudo-class in CSS?
   **Answer:** A pseudo-class is used to define a special state of an element. For example, `:hover` can be used to change a button's color when the user's pointer hovers over it.

8. **Question:** What is a pseudo-element in CSS?
   **Answer:** A pseudo-element is used to style specific parts of an element. For example, `::first-line` can be used to change the font of the first line of a paragraph.

9. **Question:** What is the use of the z-index in CSS?
   **Answer:** The `z-index` property is used to specify the stack order of an element. An element with a greater stack order is always in front of another element with a lower stack order.

10. **Question:** What is the difference between "position: relative" and "position: absolute" in CSS?
    **Answer:** An element with "position: relative" is positioned relative to its normal position. An element with "position: absolute" is positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor (instead of positioned relative to the viewport).

11. **Question:** What is the use of the `!important` rule in CSS?
    **Answer:** The `!important` rule in CSS is used to make a certain property and value the most important. This rule overrides all other styles and helps to avoid the specificity conflicts.

12. **Question:** What is a CSS preprocessor?
    **Answer:** A CSS preprocessor is a program that lets you generate CSS from the preprocessor's own unique syntax. Examples of CSS preprocessors are Sass, LESS and Stylus.

13. **Question:** What is the difference between "visibility:hidden" and "display:none" in CSS?
    **Answer:** "visibility: hidden" hides an element, but it will still take up the same space as before. "display: none" hides an element, and it will not take up any space.

14. **Question:** What is a media query in CSS?
    **Answer:** A media query is a CSS technique used to apply different styles for different media types/devices. Media queries can be used to check many things, such as width and height of the viewport, the device type, and whether the device is in portrait or landscape mode.

15. **Question:** What is the difference between a CSS reset and CSS normalize?
    **Answer:** A CSS reset aims to reduce browser inconsistencies by leveling the styling of all HTML elements to a consistent baseline. On the other hand, CSS normalize makes sure that all browsers have consistent default styles.

16. **Question:** What is CSS flexbox?
    **Answer:** CSS flexbox is a layout mode that was introduced in CSS3. It's great for laying out items in a single direction, and it offers a lot of flexibility in terms of aligning and distributing space among items.

17. **Question:** What is CSS Grid?
    **Answer:** CSS Grid is a layout system that was introduced in CSS3. It allows developers to create complex layouts more easily and consistently across browsers.

18. **Question:** What is the difference between "opacity:0" and "visibility:hidden" in CSS?
    **Answer:** "opacity: 0" makes an element completely transparent but it can still be clicked on, while "visibility: hidden" makes an element invisible and it can't be clicked on.

19. **Question:** What is the use of CSS Variables?
    **Answer:** CSS Variables, also known as CSS Custom Properties, allow you to store a value in one place, then reuse that value elsewhere in the style sheet. It makes your CSS more maintainable.

20. **Question:** What is the CSS `calc()` function?
    **Answer:** The CSS `calc()` function lets you perform calculations when specifying CSS property values. It can be used anywhere a length, frequency, angle, time, percentage, number, or integer is allowed.

felix-le: explain "opacity:0" "visibility:hidden" display:"none"

GitHub Copilot: Sure, here are explanations for `opacity: 0`, `visibility: hidden`, and `display: none` in CSS:

1. **opacity: 0:** This makes an element completely transparent but it still occupies space and can be interacted with. For example, links are still clickable and the element can still be selected or receive focus.

   ```css
   .element {
     opacity: 0;
   }
   ```

2. **visibility: hidden:** This makes an element invisible but it still occupies space in the layout. The element is removed from the flow of the document, meaning it can't be interacted with and won't catch any clicks, but the space it would normally occupy is still reserved.

   ```css
   .element {
     visibility: hidden;
   }
   ```

3. **display: none:** This removes the element completely from the document flow. It does not occupy any space, even the space it would normally occupy is removed. The element can't be interacted with and it won't affect the layout of other elements.

   ```css
   .element {
     display: none;
   }
   ```

In summary, `opacity: 0` makes an element invisible but still functional, `visibility: hidden` makes an element invisible and non-functional but still occupying space, and `display: none` makes an element completely non-existent to the layout and functionality of the page.

felix-le: visibility: hidden: This makes an element invisible but it still occupies space in the layout. The element is removed from the flow of the document, meaning it can't be interacted with and won't catch any clicks, but the space it would normally occupy is still reserved. ==> it means it still here but cannot see or click? like opacity?

GitHub Copilot: Yes, you're partially correct. Both `visibility: hidden` and `opacity: 0` make an element invisible, but there's a key difference when it comes to interaction:

- **visibility: hidden:** The element is invisible and it can't be interacted with. This means that the user can't click on it, and it won't be read by screen readers. However, it still occupies space in the layout, just as if it were visible.

```css
.element {
  visibility: hidden;
}
```

- **opacity: 0:** The element is completely transparent (invisible), but it can still be interacted with. This means that the user can still click on it, and it will still be read by screen readers. It also still occupies space in the layout.

```css
.element {
  opacity: 0;
}
```

So, while both properties can make an element invisible, `visibility: hidden` also makes it non-interactive, whereas `opacity: 0` does not.

15. **Question:** What is the `column-count` property in CSS?
    **Answer:** The `column-count` property specifies the number of columns an element should be divided into.

16. **Question:** What is the `object-fit` property in CSS?
    **Answer:** The `object-fit` property specifies how an `<img>` or `<video>` should be resized to fit its container.

17. **Question:** What is the `filter` property in CSS?
    **Answer:** The `filter` property defines visual effects (like blur and saturation) to an element (often `<img>`).

18. **Question:** What is the `backface-visibility` property in CSS?
    **Answer:** The `backface-visibility` property sets whether the back face of an element should be visible or not when facing the user.

19. **Question:** What is the `perspective` property in CSS?

    **Answer:** The `resize` property specifies whether or not an element is resizable by the user.

felix-le: tell me about collapse css

GitHub Copilot: In CSS, `collapse` is a value that can be used with certain properties. Here are a few examples:

1. **border-collapse:** The `border-collapse` property is used in tables. It specifies whether the browser should control table borders or CSS. The `collapse` value for `border-collapse` causes adjacent table cell borders to collapse into a single border.

   ```css
   table {
     border-collapse: collapse;
   }
   ```

2. **visibility: collapse:** The `collapse` value for the `visibility` property is used with table rows and row groups. It's similar to `display: none`, but it only works on table elements (`<tr>`, `<thead>`, `<tbody>`, and `<tfoot>`). When `visibility: collapse` is applied, the element it's applied to is removed, but it does not affect the table's layout. The space taken up by the row/column will be available for other content.

   ```css
   tr {
     visibility: collapse;
   }
   ```

Please note that `visibility: collapse` is not well supported in some browsers, so it's often safer to use `display: none` if you need to hide table rows or columns.

felix-le: collapse css for margin

GitHub Copilot: In CSS, the term "collapsing margins" refers to a situation where two or more adjoining vertical margins combine to form a single margin. This is a unique behavior of vertical margins (top and bottom margins) and does not apply to horizontal margins (left and right margins).

Here's an example:

```css
div {
  margin: 20px 0;
}
```

If you have two `div` elements defined as above, one after the other in your HTML, you might expect there to be a 40px gap between them (20px from the bottom margin of the first div and 20px from the top margin of the second div). However, due to margin collapsing, there will actually only be a 20px gap.

The rule is that when margins collapse, the larger margin value is used. So if one div has a bottom margin of 30px and the next div has a top margin of 20px, the actual margin between them will be 30px, not 50px.

This behavior can sometimes be confusing, but it's a fundamental part of how CSS works. Understanding it can help you create more predictable layouts.

felix-le: What are the different types of CSS selectors?

GitHub Copilot: CSS selectors are used to select the HTML elements you want to style. Here are the different types of CSS selectors:

1. **Type Selector:** Also known as an element selector. It selects elements based on the element type. For example, `p { color: red; }` will apply the style to all `<p>` elements.

2. **Class Selector:** Selects elements based on the class attribute. It's represented by a period followed by the class name. For example, `.myClass { color: red; }` will apply the style to all elements with `class="myClass"`.

3. **ID Selector:** Selects an element based on the id attribute. It's represented by a hash followed by the id name. For example, `#myID { color: red; }` will apply the style to the element with `id="myID"`.

4. **Universal Selector:** Selects all elements. It's represented by an asterisk (_). For example, `_ { color: red; }` will apply the style to all elements.

5. **Attribute Selector:** Selects elements based on an attribute or attribute value. For example, `a[target="_blank"] { color: red; }` will apply the style to all `<a>` elements with `target="_blank"`.

6. **Pseudo-class Selector:** Selects elements based on a certain state. For example, `a:hover { color: red; }` will apply the style to `<a>` elements when they're being hovered over.

7. **Pseudo-element Selector:** Selects a part of an element. For example, `p::first-letter { color: red; }` will apply the style to the first letter of every `<p>` element.

8. **Descendant Combinator:** Selects an element that is a descendant of another element. For example, `div p { color: red; }` will apply the style to all `<p>` elements that are inside a `<div>` element.

9. **Child Combinator:** Selects an element that is a direct child of another element. For example, `div > p { color: red; }` will apply the style to all `<p>` elements that are direct children of a `<div>`.

10. **Adjacent Sibling Combinator:** Selects an element that is directly after another specific element. For example, `div + p { color: red; }` will apply the style to a `<p>` element if it directly follows a `<div>` element.

11. **General Sibling Combinator:** Selects an element that follows another specific element. For example, `div ~ p { color: red; }` will apply the style to any `<p>` element that follows a `<div>` element.

Each of these selectors has a different level of specificity, which determines which styles are applied if there are conflicts. The more specific a selector is, the higher priority its styles will have.

felix-le: explain and give an example about currentColor

GitHub Copilot: The `currentColor` keyword in CSS is used to refer to the current color value of an element. It represents the computed value of the `color` property for that element. This can be used as a value for any property that accepts a color value, such as `border-color`, `background-color`, or `box-shadow`.

Here's an example:

```css
button {
  color: red;
  border: 2px solid currentColor;
  background-color: currentColor;
}
```

In this example, the `button` element will have a red text color, a red border, and a red background. The `currentColor` keyword is used to match the border and background color to the text color. If you change the `color` property to another color, the border and background color will automatically update to match it.

felix-le: so it will be red?

GitHub Copilot: Yes, in the provided example, the text, border, and background color of the button will all be red. This is because the `color` property is set to red, and the `border` and `background-color` properties are set to `currentColor`, which refers to the current color of the element, in this case, red. If you were to change the `color` property to, say, blue, then the text, border, and background color would all become blue.

felix-le: give me 20 questions about reactjs

GitHub Copilot: Sure, here are 20 questions about React.js:

1. **Question:** What is React.js?
   **Answer:** React.js is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, primarily for single-page applications. It's used for handling the view layer in web and mobile apps. React allows you to design simple views for each state in your application, and it will efficiently update and render the right components when your data changes.

2. **Question:** What is JSX in React?
   **Answer:** JSX stands for JavaScript XML. It is a syntax extension for JavaScript, used by React to describe what the UI should look like. JSX produces React "elements".

3. **Question:** What are components in React?
   **Answer:** Components are independent and reusable bits of code. They serve the same purpose as JavaScript functions, but work in isolation and return HTML via a render function.

4. **Question:** What is the difference between a class component and a functional component in React?
   **Answer:** Class components are ES6 classes that extend from `React.Component` and have a render method. They can have lifecycle methods and state. Functional components are simpler and are just JavaScript functions that return JSX. They can't have lifecycle methods or state by themselves, but can use hooks to have those features.

5. **Question:** What are props in React?
   **Answer:** Props (short for properties) are a way of passing data from parent to child components. They are read-only.

6. **Question:** What is state in React?
   **Answer:** State is a data structure that starts with a default value when a component mounts. It may be mutated across time, mostly as a result of user events.

7. **Question:** What are hooks in React?
   **Answer:** Hooks are a new addition in React 16.8 that let you use state and other React features without writing a class. Examples of hooks are `useState` and `useEffect`.

8. **Question:** What is the virtual DOM in React?
   **Answer:** The virtual DOM (VDOM) is a programming concept where an ideal, or “virtual”, representation of a UI is kept in memory and synced with the “real” DOM by a library such as ReactDOM. This process is called reconciliation.

9. **Question:** What is the difference between `state` and `props` in React?
   **Answer:** `state` is a data structure that starts with a default value when a component mounts and may be mutated across time, mostly as a result of user events. `props` (short for properties) are a way of passing data from parent to child components. They are read-only.

10. **Question:** What are lifecycle methods in React?
    **Answer:** Lifecycle methods are special methods in the React component class that automatically get called as your component gets rendered, updated, and unmounted.

11. **Question:** What is Redux in the context of React?
    **Answer:** Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps. It helps you write applications that behave consistently, run in different environments (client, server, and native), and are easy to test.

12. **Question:** What is Context API in React?
    **Answer:** The Context API is a component structure provided by the React framework, which enables us to share specific forms of data across all levels of the application.

13. **Question:** What is a higher-order component (HOC) in React?
    **Answer:** A higher-order component (HOC) in React is a pattern that is derived from React’s compositional nature. HOCs are a way of reusing component logic. HOCs are not part of the React API. They are a pattern that emerges from React’s compositional nature.

14. **Question:** What is a Fragment in React?
    **Answer:** Fragments let you group a list of children without adding extra nodes to the DOM.

15. **Question:** What is the purpose of `React.createRef()`?
    **Answer:** `React.createRef()` is a function that returns a ref object which can be attached to React elements via the ref attribute. It allows you to interact with the element directly in ways that are not otherwise possible from within the React component model.

16. **Question:** What is the purpose of `React.forwardRef()`?
    **Answer:** `React.forwardRef()` is a method that allows you to access the ref of a child component from a parent component. This is useful in some cases, like focusing on input fields or managing focus order.

17. **Question:** What is the purpose of `React.memo()`?
    **Answer:** `React.memo()` is a higher order component that memoizes the result of a function component and returns the result when the same props are provided.

18. **Question:** What is the purpose of `React.lazy()`?
    **Answer:** `React.lazy()` is a function that lets you render a dynamic import as a regular component. It makes it easy to code split and lazy load components in a React app.

19. **Question:** What is the purpose of `React.StrictMode`?
    **Answer:** `React.StrictMode` is a wrapper component that checks for potential problems in the application during the development build.

20. **Question:** What is the purpose of `React.PureComponent`?
    **Answer:** `React.PureComponent` is similar to `React.Component`. The difference between them is that `React.Component` doesn’t implement `shouldComponentUpdate()`, but `React.PureComponent` implements it with a shallow prop and state comparison.

felix-le: What are React hooks and how do they work?

GitHub Copilot: React Hooks are a feature introduced in React 16.8 that allow you to use state and other React features without writing a class. They let you use state and other React features inside functional components, where this wasn't possible before.

Here's a brief explanation of some of the most commonly used hooks:

1. **useState:** This hook lets you add React state to functional components. The `useState` hook returns a pair: the current state value and a function that lets you update it. You can call this function from an event handler or somewhere else.

```javascript
import React, { useState } from "react";

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Click me</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

2. **useEffect:** This hook lets you perform side effects in function components. Data fetching, subscriptions, or manually changing the DOM from React components are examples of side effects. `useEffect` serves the same purpose as `componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate`, and `componentWillUnmount` in React classes, but unified into a single API.

```javascript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from "react";

function Example() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  // Similar to componentDidMount and componentDidUpdate:
  useEffect(() => {
    // Update the document title using the browser API
    document.title = `You clicked ${count} times`;
  });

  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Click me</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

3. **useContext:** This hook lets you subscribe to React context without introducing nesting. It lets you read the context and subscribe to its changes from a function component.

```javascript
import React, { useContext } from "react";
const ThemeContext = React.createContext("light");

function ThemedButton() {
  const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);
  return <button theme={theme}>I'm styled by theme context!</button>;
}
```

Hooks are all about making function components able to do everything that class components can do, but in a simpler way. They don't work inside classes — they let you use React without classes.

felix-le: explain useMemo and memo(), difference

GitHub Copilot: `useMemo` and `memo` are both performance optimization techniques in React but they serve different purposes.

1. **useMemo:** `useMemo` is a React hook that is used to memoize expensive functions i.e., functions that take a lot of computations. It returns a memoized version of the function that only re-runs when one of the dependencies has changed. It's useful when you have a function that performs heavy computation and you want to avoid calling this function unnecessarily.

```javascript
import React, { useMemo } from "react";

function MyComponent({ a, b }) {
  const value = useMemo(() => {
    // Perform heavy computation here
    return computeExpensiveValue(a, b);
  }, [a, b]);

  return <div>{value}</div>;
}
```

In the above example, `computeExpensiveValue(a, b)` is only re-computed when either `a` or `b` changes, not on every render.

2. **memo:** `React.memo` is a higher order component that memoizes the result of a function component and returns the result when the same props are provided. It's similar to `PureComponent` but for function components. It's useful when you have a component that renders the same result given the same props and you want to avoid re-rendering it unnecessarily.

```javascript
import React, { memo } from "react";

const MyComponent = memo(function MyComponent(props) {
  // Your component code
});
```

In the above example, `MyComponent` will only re-render if its props change.

**Difference:** The key difference is that `useMemo` is for memoizing values, while `React.memo` is for memoizing components. `useMemo` is a hook that returns a memoized value, `React.memo` is a higher order component that returns a memoized component.

felix-le: What are some other commonly used React hooks?

GitHub Copilot: In addition to `useState`, `useEffect`, and `useContext`, there are several other built-in hooks provided by React:

1. **useReducer:** An alternative to `useState`. Accepts a reducer of type `(state, action) => newState`, and returns the current state paired with a `dispatch` method. This is usually preferable to `useState` when you have complex state logic that involves multiple sub-values or when the next state depends on the previous one.

```javascript
import React, { useReducer } from "react";

const initialState = { count: 0 };

function reducer(state, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case "increment":
      return { count: state.count + 1 };
    case "decrement":
      return { count: state.count - 1 };
    default:
      throw new Error();
  }
}

function Counter() {
  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState);
  return (
    <>
      Count: {state.count}
      <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: "increment" })}>+</button>
      <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: "decrement" })}>-</button>
    </>
  );
}
```

2. **useCallback:** Returns a memoized version of the callback that only changes if one of the dependencies has changed. This is useful when passing callbacks to optimized child components that rely on reference equality to prevent unnecessary renders.

```javascript
import React, { useState, useCallback } from "react";

function App() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  const increment = useCallback(() => {
    setCount(count + 1);
  }, [count]);

  return (
    <div>
      Count: {count}
      <button onClick={increment}>Increase</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

3. **useRef:** Returns a mutable ref object whose `.current` property is initialized to the passed argument (`initialValue`). The returned object will persist for the full lifetime of the component. It's handy for keeping any mutable value around similar to how you’d use instance fields in classes.

```javascript
import React, { useRef } from "react";

function TextInputWithFocusButton() {
  const inputEl = useRef(null);
  const onButtonClick = () => {
    // `current` points to the mounted text input element
    inputEl.current.focus();
  };
  return (
    <>
      <input ref={inputEl} type="text" />
      <button onClick={onButtonClick}>Focus the input</button>
    </>
  );
}
```

4. **useMemo:** Returns a memoized value. Pass a “create” function and an array of dependencies. `useMemo` will only recompute the memoized value when one of the dependencies has changed. This optimization helps to avoid expensive calculations on every render.

```javascript
import React, { useMemo } from "react";

function MyComponent({ a, b }) {
  const value = useMemo(() => {
    // Perform expensive computation here
    return computeExpensiveValue(a, b);
  }, [a, b]);

  return <div>{value}</div>;
}
```

5. **useImperativeHandle:** Customizes the instance value that is exposed to parent components when using `ref`. As always, imperative code using refs should be avoided in most cases. `useImperativeHandle` should be used with `React.forwardRef`.

```javascript
import React, { useRef, useImperativeHandle, forwardRef } from 'react';

function FancyInput(props, ref) {
  const inputRef = useRef();
  useImperativeHandle(ref, () => ({
    focus: () => {
      inputRef.current.focus();
    }
  }));
  return <input ref={inputRef} ... />;
}
FancyInput = forwardRef(FancyInput);
```

6. **useLayoutEffect:** The signature is identical to `useEffect`, but it fires synchronously after all DOM mutations. Use this to read layout from the DOM and synchronously re-render. Updates scheduled inside `useLayoutEffect` will be flushed synchronously, before the browser has a chance to paint.

7. **useDebugValue:** Can be used to display a label for custom hooks in React DevTools.

```javascript
useDebugValue(date.toLocaleDateString());
```

These are the built-in hooks provided by React, but you can also create your own custom hooks to extract component logic into reusable functions.

felix-le: What are some commonly used React hooks for handling form inputs?

GitHub Copilot: Handling form inputs in React typically involves managing state and handling events. The most commonly used hooks for this are `useState` and `useEffect`. However, for more complex forms, you might want to use `useReducer` for more predictable state management.

Here's a simple example of how you might use `useState` to handle form inputs:

```javascript
import React, { useState } from "react";

function Form() {
  const [name, setName] = useState("");
  const [email, setEmail] = useState("");

  const handleSubmit = (event) => {
    event.preventDefault();
    // Handle form submission
  };

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      <label>
        Name:
        <input
          type="text"
          value={name}
          onChange={(e) => setName(e.target.value)}
        />
      </label>
      <label>
        Email:
        <input
          type="email"
          value={email}
          onChange={(e) => setEmail(e.target.value)}
        />
      </label>
      <input type="submit" value="Submit" />
    </form>
  );
}
```

In this example, `useState` is used to manage the state of the `name` and `email` inputs. The `onChange` event handler updates the state with the current input value.

For more complex forms, you might want to use `useReducer` instead. This allows you to manage the state of multiple inputs using a reducer function, which can make your state updates more predictable and easier to understand.

In addition to these built-in hooks, there are also several popular libraries that provide custom hooks for form handling, such as Formik and react-hook-form. These libraries provide hooks like `useFormik` and `useForm`, which can simplify form handling and provide additional features like validation and error handling.

felix-le: give me 20 questions about reactjs and answer: don't be dupcate above

GitHub Copilot: Sure, here are 20 more questions about React.js along with their answers:

1. **What is the purpose of `React.Fragment`?**
   `React.Fragment` is a common pattern in React for a component to return multiple elements. Fragments let you group a list of children without adding extra nodes to the DOM.

2. **What is prop drilling and how can you avoid it?**
   Prop drilling is the process by which you pass data from one part of the React Component tree to another by going through other parts that do not need the data but are merely passing it down. This can be avoided by using Context API or Redux for state management.

3. **What is the difference between `React.PureComponent` and `React.Component`?**
   `React.PureComponent` performs a shallow comparison on the new props and state, and reduces the chance that `render()` will run when it doesn't need to. `React.Component`, on the other hand, doesn't implement `shouldComponentUpdate()`, so `render()` will run whenever `setState()` is called.

4. **What is the purpose of `defaultProps`?**
   `defaultProps` allows you to set default props for your component. It’s used for undefined props, but not for null props.

5. **What is the difference between `useState` and `useReducer`?**
   `useState` is a Hook that lets you add React state to function components, while `useReducer` is usually preferable to `useState` when you have complex state logic that involves multiple sub-values or when the next state depends on the previous one.

6. **What is the purpose of `useRef`?**
   `useRef` returns a mutable ref object whose `.current` property is initialized to the passed argument. The returned object will persist for the full lifetime of the component. It's handy for keeping any mutable value around similar to how you’d use instance fields in classes.

7. **What is the difference between `useCallback` and `useMemo`?**
   `useCallback` returns a memoized version of the callback that only changes if one of the dependencies has changed. `useMemo` is a Hook that returns a memoized value.

8. **What is the purpose of `React.forwardRef`?**
   `React.forwardRef` is used to pass `ref` from a parent component to a child component. This is useful when a parent component needs access to an element in a child component.

9. **What is the difference between a controlled component and an uncontrolled component?**
   In a controlled component, form data is handled by a React component. In an uncontrolled component, form data is handled by the DOM itself.

10. **What is the purpose of `React.createRef`?**
    `React.createRef` creates a `ref` that can be attached to React elements via the `ref` attribute. It’s used for accessing the properties of an element or a component directly.

11. **What is reconciliation in React?**
    Reconciliation is the process through which React updates the DOM. When a component's state changes, React needs to determine whether an actual DOM update is necessary. It does this by creating a new tree of React elements and diffing it with the most recent tree.

12. **What is the purpose of `React.lazy`?**
    `React.lazy` is a function that lets you render a dynamic import as a regular component. It makes it easy to code-split your app into smaller bundles that can be loaded on demand, which can significantly improve performance for larger apps.

13. **What is the purpose of `React.Suspense`?**
    `React.Suspense` lets your components “wait” for something before they can render, such as data fetching. It can be used to specify loading indicators.

14. **What is the purpose of error boundaries in React?**
    Error boundaries are React components that catch JavaScript errors anywhere in their child component tree, log those errors, and display a fallback UI instead of the component tree that crashed.

15. **What is the difference between `componentDidMount` and `useEffect`?**
    `componentDidMount` is a lifecycle method in class components where you run side-effects that require the DOM like fetching data, while `useEffect` is a Hook that combines `componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate`, and `componentWillUnmount` in functional components.

16. **What is the purpose of `React.memo`?**
    `React.memo` is a higher order component that memoizes the result of a function component and returns the result when the same props are provided. It's similar to `PureComponent` but for function components.

17. **What is context in React?**
    Context provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level. It's designed to share data that can be considered “global” for a tree of React components.

18. **What is the purpose of `React.cloneElement`?**
    `React.cloneElement` is used to clone a single React element and apply additional props to it.

19. **What is the purpose of `React.Children` API?**
    `React.Children` provides utilities for dealing with the `this.props.children` opaque data structure.

20. **What is the purpose of `React.StrictMode`?**
    `React.StrictMode` is a wrapper component that checks for potential problems in the application during the development build. It does not render any visible UI, and activates additional checks and warnings for its descendants.

GitHub Copilot: Sure, here are 20 more questions about React.js along with their answers:

1. **What is a React Portal and when is it used?**
   React Portal provides a way to render children into a DOM node that exists outside the DOM hierarchy of the parent component. It's used for components like modals, tooltips, etc.

2. **What is the difference between `null` and `undefined` in React?**
   In React, `undefined` props are replaced with their default values, while `null` props are not.

3. **What is the purpose of `shouldComponentUpdate` in React?**
   `shouldComponentUpdate` is a lifecycle method that allows you to optimize your application by avoiding unnecessary re-renders. It determines if a re-render is necessary by comparing the current and next props and state.

4. **What is the difference between `componentWillUnmount` and `useEffect` cleanup function?**
   `componentWillUnmount` is a lifecycle method in class components where you perform cleanup tasks like invalidating timers or cancelling network requests. The cleanup function in `useEffect` serves the same purpose in functional components.

5. **What is the purpose of `React.Profiler`?**
   `React.Profiler` is a component for measuring the performance of React components. It can be used to measure how often a React application renders and what the "cost" of rendering is.

6. **What is the difference between `state` and `setState` in React?**
   `state` is a built-in object that contains data about the component. `setState` is a method that allows you to update this state and re-render the component.

7. **What is the purpose of `React.isValidElement`?**
   `React.isValidElement` is a method that checks if a value is a valid React element. It's handy for type checking in your components.

8. **What is the purpose of `React.Children.only`?**
   `React.Children.only` verifies that a component has only one child and returns it. If the component has more than one child, it will throw an error.

9. **What is the purpose of `React.Children.toArray`?**
   `React.Children.toArray` takes a structure of nested arrays and strings and returns a flat array with keys assigned to each child.

10. **What is the purpose of `React.Children.map`?**

12. **What is the purpose of `React.Children.forEach`?**
    `React.Children.forEach` is similar to `React.Children.map` but it does not return an array.

13. **What is the purpose of `React.cloneElement`?**
    `React.cloneElement` is used to clone a single React element and apply additional props to it.

14. **What is the purpose of `React.createFactory`?**
    `React.createFactory` is a legacy helper for creating React components. It's not recommended for use in new code.

15. **What is the purpose of `React.lazy` and `React.Suspense`?**
    `React.lazy` is a function that lets you render a dynamic import as a regular component. `React.Suspense` lets your components “wait” for something before they can render, such as data fetching. It can be used to specify loading indicators.

16. **What is the purpose of `React.StrictMode`?**

felix-le: What are some commonly used React hooks for handling asynchronous data fetching?

GitHub Copilot: React provides several hooks that can be used to handle asynchronous data fetching:

1. **`useState`:** This hook is used to create local state in a function component. When fetching data, you can use `useState` to store the data and update the state when the data is received.

```javascript
const [data, setData] = useState(null);
```

2. **`useEffect`:** This hook is used to perform side effects in function components. It can be used to fetch data when a component mounts, and to update the data when the component updates. The `useEffect` hook takes two arguments: a function where you can put your side effect logic, and an array of dependencies.

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  async function fetchData() {
    const response = await fetch("https://api.example.com/data");
    const data = await response.json();
    setData(data);
  }
  fetchData();
}, []); // Empty array means this effect runs once on mount and clean up on unmount
```

3. **`useReducer`:** This hook is an alternative to `useState` that is preferable when you have complex state logic that involves multiple sub-values or when the next state depends on the previous one. It's also useful when working with global state.

```javascript
const dataFetchReducer = (state, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case "FETCH_INIT":
      return { ...state, isLoading: true, isError: false };
    case "FETCH_SUCCESS":
      return {
        ...state,
        isLoading: false,
        isError: false,
        data: action.payload,
      };
    case "FETCH_FAILURE":
      return { ...state, isLoading: false, isError: true };
    default:
      throw new Error();
  }
};

const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(dataFetchReducer, {
  isLoading: false,
  isError: false,
  data: null,
});
```

4. **`useCallback`:** This hook returns a memoized version of the callback that only changes if one of the dependencies has changed. It's useful when passing callbacks to optimized child components that rely on reference equality to prevent unnecessary renders.

```javascript
const memoizedCallback = useCallback(() => {
  doSomething(a, b);
}, [a, b]);
```

5. **`useRef`:** This hook can be used to store the current promise or other mutable values that represent a "current" state in an asynchronous operation.

```javascript
const abortRef = useRef();
useEffect(() => {
  abortRef.current = new AbortController();
  const fetchData = async () => {
    try {
      const response = await fetch("https://api.example.com/data", {
        signal: abortRef.current.signal,
      });
      const data = await response.json();
      setData(data);
    } catch (error) {
      if (error.name === "AbortError") {
        console.log("Fetch cancelled");
      } else {
        throw error;
      }
    }
  };
  fetchData();
  return () => {
    abortRef.current.abort();
  };
}, []);
```

Please note that while these hooks can be used to handle asynchronous data fetching, there are also third-party libraries like `react-query` and `swr` that provide more advanced hooks for data fetching with features like caching, automatic refetching, and background updates.

felix-le: 20 questions and answer about redux

GitHub Copilot: Sure, here are 20 questions and answers about Redux:

1. **What is Redux?**
   Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript applications. It helps you write applications that behave consistently, run in different environments (client, server, and native), and are easy to test.

2. **What are the three principles that Redux follows?**
   The three principles are: Single source of truth, State is read-only, and Changes are made with pure functions.

3. **What is a Redux store?**
   A Redux store is an object which brings together the state, actions, and reducers.

4. **What is a Redux action?**
   Actions are payloads of information that send data from your application to your Redux store.

5. **What is a Redux reducer?**
   Reducers specify how the application's state changes in response to actions sent to the store.

6. **What is the use of the `combineReducers` function?**
   The `combineReducers` helper function turns an object whose values are different reducing functions into a single reducing function you can pass to `createStore`.

7. **What is the use of the `applyMiddleware` function?**
   `applyMiddleware` is a Redux method that allows you to use middleware with your Redux store.

8. **What is Redux Thunk?**
   Redux Thunk is a middleware that allows you to write action creators that return a function instead of an action.

9. **What is the difference between `mapStateToProps` and `mapDispatchToProps`?**
   `mapStateToProps` is used for selecting the part of the data from the store that the connected component needs. `mapDispatchToProps` is used for dispatching actions to the store.

10. **What is the use of the `connect` function in Redux?**
    The `connect` function connects a React component to a Redux store.

11. **What is Redux Saga?**
    Redux Saga is a library that aims to make application side effects easier to manage, more efficient to execute, easy to test, and better at handling failures.

12. **What is the difference between Redux Saga and Redux Thunk?**
    Both are middleware libraries that handle side effects in your Redux app. Thunk is simpler and great for simple needs, while Saga uses generators and is more powerful and complex, suitable for handling more complicated operations.

12. **What is JWT?**
    JWT, or JSON Web Token, is an open standard for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object.

13. **What is the difference between OAuth and JWT?**
    OAuth is a protocol for authorization, while JWT is a standard for creating tokens that assert some number of claims.

14. **What is a load balancer?**
    A load balancer is a device that distributes network or application traffic across a cluster of servers.

15. **What is a firewall?**
    A firewall is a network security system that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules.

16. **What is a DDoS attack?**
    A DDoS attack, or Distributed Denial of Service attack, is an attempt to make an online service unavailable by overwhelming it with traffic from multiple sources.

17. **What is a CSRF attack?**
    A CSRF attack, or Cross-Site Request Forgery attack, is an attack that tricks the victim into submitting a malicious request.

18. **What is an XSS attack?**
    An XSS attack, or Cross-Site Scripting attack, is a type of injection attack in which malicious scripts are injected into trusted websites.

19. **What is a Same-Origin Policy?**
    The Same-Origin Policy is a critical security mechanism that restricts how a document or script loaded from one origin can interact with a resource from another origin.

20. **What is a Content Security Policy?**
    A Content Security Policy (CSP) is a computer security standard introduced to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS), clickjacking and other code injection attacks resulting from execution of malicious content in the trusted web page context.

felix-le: What are some best practices for securing frontend applications against common web vulnerabilities?

GitHub Copilot: Here are some best practices for securing frontend applications against common web vulnerabilities:

1. **Use HTTPS**: Always use HTTPS instead of HTTP to protect your application from man-in-the-middle attacks.

2. **Content Security Policy (CSP)**: Implement CSP to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. CSP provides a standard method for website owners to declare approved origins of content that browsers should be allowed to load.

3. **Input Validation**: Always validate user input to protect your application from various forms of attacks, such as SQL injection, script injection, and more.

4. **Encode Data**: Always encode user data before displaying it in the UI to prevent XSS attacks.

5. **Use HTTPOnly Cookies**: Use HTTPOnly cookies to protect your cookies from being accessed by client-side scripts.

6. **Use Secure and SameSite Cookies**: Secure cookies are only sent over HTTPS, and SameSite cookies are only sent when requests originate from the same domain. This helps to prevent cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks.

7. **Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)**: Be careful when configuring CORS. Allow only necessary domains to prevent CSRF attacks.

8. **Use Anti-CSRF Tokens**: Use anti-CSRF tokens in your forms to protect your application from CSRF attacks.

9. **Update Dependencies**: Regularly update your dependencies to protect your application from known vulnerabilities.

10. **Avoid Using eval()**: The JavaScript eval() function is dangerous because it executes the code it's passed with the privileges of the caller.

11. **Use Subresource Integrity (SRI)**: SRI is a security feature that enables browsers to verify that resources they fetch are delivered without unexpected manipulation.

12. **Limit the Rate of Requests**: Implement rate limiting to protect your application from brute-force attacks.

13. **Use a Web Application Firewall (WAF)**: A WAF can help protect your web applications by filtering and monitoring HTTP traffic between a web application and the Internet.

14. **Use Security Headers**: There are several HTTP headers that can add layers of security to your application, such as X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options, and Strict-Transport-Security.

15. **Educate Yourself and Your Team**: Stay informed about the latest security threats and mitigation techniques. Regularly conduct security training and awareness programs for your team.

felix-le: What are some best practices for handling user authentication and authorization in frontend applications?

GitHub Copilot: Here are some best practices for handling user authentication and authorization in frontend applications:

1. **Use HTTPS**: Always use HTTPS for all authenticated traffic to protect user credentials and session tokens from being exposed to eavesdroppers.

2. **Hash Passwords**: Never store passwords in plain text. Always hash and salt passwords before storing them.

3. **Use JWT for Stateless Authentication**: JSON Web Tokens (JWT) are a good choice for stateless authentication. They can be signed using a secret or a public/private key pair.

4. **Store Tokens Securely**: If you're using tokens for authentication, make sure they are stored securely. Avoid storing tokens in local storage as they can be susceptible to XSS attacks. Consider using HTTPOnly cookies.

5. **Implement Session Timeout**: Implement automatic session timeouts and logouts after a period of inactivity.

6. **Use Multi-Factor Authentication**: Consider using multi-factor authentication for added security.

7. **Use OAuth for Third-Party Authentication**: If you're allowing users to authenticate with a third-party service (like Google or Facebook), use a standard protocol like OAuth.

8. **Implement Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting on login attempts to protect against brute-force attacks.

9. **Encrypt Sensitive Data**: Always encrypt sensitive data, even if it's stored in a secure location.

10. **Use Secure and SameSite Cookies**: Secure cookies are only sent over HTTPS, and SameSite cookies are only sent when requests originate from the same domain. This helps to prevent CSRF attacks.

11. **Use Proper Error Messages**: Don't reveal too much information in your error messages. For example, instead of saying "Invalid password", consider saying "Invalid username or password".

12. **Update Dependencies**: Regularly update your dependencies to protect your application from known vulnerabilities.

13. **Use CORS and CSP Policies**: Be careful when configuring Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) and Content Security Policy (CSP). They can help prevent unauthorized access to your resources.

14. **Authorization Checks**: Always perform authorization checks on the server-side. Don't rely solely on hiding UI elements on the frontend.

15. **Educate Your Users**: Encourage your users to use strong, unique passwords and to protect their credentials.
